The ASWF hosts several of the foundational projects that are ubiquitously used in the production of visual effects and feature animation.

It provides support for enforcing authorization based on various access control models like ACL, RBAC, ABAC for Golang, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, .NET (C#), Delphi and Rust.

What Casbin does:

- Enforce the policy in the classic {subject, object, action} form or a customized form as you defined, both allow and deny authorizations are supported.
- Handle the storage of the access control model and its policy.
- Manage the role-user mappings and role-role mappings (aka role hierarchy in RBAC). Support built-in superuser like root or administrator.
- A superuser can do anything without explict permissions.
- Multiple built-in operators to support the rule matching. For example, keyMatch can map a resource key /foo/bar to the pattern /foo*.

What Casbin does NOT do:

- Authentication (aka verify username and password when a user logs in) Manage the list of users or roles. I believe it's more convenient for the project itself to manage these entities.
- Users usually have their passwords, and Casbin is not designed as a password container. However, Casbin stores the user-role mapping for the RBAC scenario.

CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, https://home.cern) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.

The experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.

The open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others.

Unhealthy projects can have negative impacts on the community involved in the project as well as organizations that rely on such projects. In response, people want to know more about the open-source projects they are engaged with. For example:

1. Open source contributors want to know where they should place their efforts and know that they are making an impact.

2. Open source communities want to attract new members, ensure consistent quality, and reward valuable members.
3. Open source companies want to know which communities to engage with, communicate the impact the organization has on the community, and evaluate the work of their employees within open source.

Open source foundations want to identify and respond to community needs, evaluate the impact of their work, and promote communities.
In response to these issues, the CHAOSS project develops metrics, practices, and software for making open source project health more understandable. By building measures of open source project health, CHAOSS seeks to improve the transparency and actionability of open source project health so that relevant stakeholders can make more informed decisions about open source project engagement.

The project goals are to:
1. Establish standard implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community health

2. Produce integrated open source software for analyzing software community development

3. Develop programs for the deployment of metrics not attainable through online trace data

The coreboot project believes in the principles of Open Source software. It borrows many well known concepts from other Open Source projects: Kconfig, Linux kernel coding style, git repository, and Gerrit for code reviews.
coreboot has numerous advantages over other firmware projects. It comes with SoC support available to all developers. The codebase is shared with developers and companies which are helping to improve the SoC and driver-specific implementations.

** Extremely fast **
- coreboot is designed to do the minimum amount necessary and get out of the way.
- Desktop and Notebooks boot up in 400ms - 2.5s.
- Server boot time can be as low as a quarter of the OEM BIOS boot time.


** Flexible and customizable **
- Because coreboot only does hardware init, then jumps to a payload to continue, it is very flexible.
- GPLv2 licensed core. Payloads can be proprietary and we offer a BSD licensed support library. coreboot provides ready-to-build payloads like UEFI, SeaBIOS, U-Boot, Grub2 and many more.
- Recovery Mode based on multiple copies of the firmware which can be updated independently.
- Integrity of stages and binaries in coreboot can be easily verified.
- Designed for security by default.
- Uses a minimal trusted computing base for each platform which is easily auditable, helping to guarantee security. As coreboot is Open Source, anyone can check the codebase.

** Debugging **
- There are multiple ways to extract the boot log, from classic serial to EHCI debug, even over the pc-speaker.
- GDB Stub support via serial.
- In memory console log support.
- Tracing functions and other exotic features are supported.",https://doc.coreboot.org/contributing/project_ideas.html

- Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org) was created in 1999 in preparation for the publication of the first draft of the human genome, to allow researchers and clinicians to start translating the secrets hidden within the human genome into real world applications. Ensembl has grown into a champion of biodiversity, providing data for tens of thousands of species across our vertebrate, metazoa, plant, fungi and bacterial divisions.

- MGnify (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics) provides a free to use platform for the assembly, analysis and archiving of microbiome data derived from sequencing microbial populations that are present in particular environments. Over the past 2 years, MGnify has more than doubled the number of publicly available analysed datasets held within the resource.

- WormBase (https://wormbase.org/) is one of the World's oldest active bioinformatic resources, more than 20 years old. We scan all published literature and datasets on the model organism C. elegans, to create a very comprehensive resouce of genomics, strains, experiments, paper and people, aimed towards accelerating research and discoveries in fundamental biology as well as human health.

- The Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) and its sibling project the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) are jointly responsible for defining the official names of genes in human and key vertebrate species. This official nomenclature ensures that studies and results on the same gene can easily be aggregated. 

Given the rapid pace of generation of genomics and sequencing data, we support a fast-evolving software stack, and are constantly investigating new solutions for data storage, processing, distribution and display.

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.

Put another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.

The goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great?

One of our ambitions is to fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations. Towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools. GeomScale aims in serving as a building block for an international, interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical and statistical computing. The main development is currently performed in volesti, a generic open source C++ library, with R and python interfaces (the latter is hosted in package dingo), for high-dimensional sampling, volume approximation, and copula estimation for financial modelling. In particular, the current implementation scales up to hundred or thousand dimensions, depending on the problem. To our knowledge it is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date. It is, in several cases, orders of magnitude faster compared to packages that solve the same problems. It can be used to compute challenging multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in systems biology by analyzing large metabolic networks (e.g., the latest human network) and in FinTech by detecting shock events and by evaluating portfolios performance in stock markets with thousands of assets.

You can use GNU Radio to write applications to receive and transmit data with radio hardware, or to create entirely simulation-based applications. GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronization elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.

GNU Radio applications can be written in either C++ or Python, while the performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions where available. This enables the developer to implement real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment.",https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=GSoCIdeas

Linux-based distributions stack up software – the Linux kernel, the X Window System, and various DEs with disparate toolkits such as GTK+ and Qt – that do not necessarily share the same guidelines and/or goals. This lack of consistency and overall vision manifests itself in increased complexity, insufficient integration, and inefficient solutions, making the use of your computer more complicated than it should actually be.

Instead, Haiku has a single focus on personal computing and is driven by a unified vision for the whole OS.

The language natively supports lazy evaluation, and lets you track side effects in the type system.

By controlling side effects and working with immutable data, the programmer can avoid whole classes of bugs.

Haskell generally compiles to fast, native code, but it can also be compiled to other targets like JavaScript (through GHCJS) or LLVM.

In Google Summer of Code, we attempt to improve not only the language, but the whole ecosystem. This includes (aside from the language itself):

- Compilers

The Catrobat project develops useful frameworks to create games, animations, or apps easily within a short time. This set of mobile creativity tools for smartphones is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.

Our awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need for any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in just a few steps using visual ""Bricks"". Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special ""Bricks"" for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on ""Pocket Code"" for iOS and on a large number of extensions. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up-to-date to meet the current needs of our users.

Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org), our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions.

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.
LibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.
We believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.
Though the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.
The community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.",https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/GSoC/Ideas

It started off as a Google 20% project to run Google Earth across a small cluster of PC's and it has grown from there! 
Liquid Galaxy hardware consists of one or more computers driving multiple displays. Liquid Galaxy applications have been developed using a master/slave architecture. The view orientation of each slave display is configured in reference to the view of the master display. Navigation on the system is done from the master instance and the location on the master is broadcast to the slaves over UDP. The slave instances, knowing their own locations in reference to the master, then change their views accordingly.
The Liquid Galaxy Project, while making use of Google Earth software, does not develop the Google Earth code-base itself. Google Earth is not open-source software, although it is free (as in beer). Instead, the Liquid Galaxy Project works on extending the Liquid Galaxy system with open-source software both improving its administration and enabling open-source applications, so that content of various types can be displayed in the immersive panoramic environment.
Artificial Intelligence focus:
2023 was the AI year, and as the mainstream market demands, 2024 and the coming years will still be a very hot topic. At the Liquid Galaxy community, we’ve been using AI for years to obtain data to be shown on Google Earth for our projects, using TensorFlow and more. Last year we made some specific advances incorporating an Artificial Intelligence server inside our rig LAN, managing with dockers the different projects, implementing local models for different functionalities, and having artificial voices in our system. Also last year we incorporated Google’s Mediapipe-based project Gameface to be able to control the Liquid Galaxy just with your face!

It is written by scientists for scientists and is used for cutting edge research in biophysics, chemistry, soft-matter physics, and materials research around the world in academia and national research labs. MDAnalysis strives to be highly interoperable and hence a growing number of projects use MDAnalysis as their foundational library or integrate it.

The goal of MDAnalysis is to make it easy for users to analyze data that are produced by simulations (primarily molecular dynamics simulations) that run on some of the largest supercomputers in the world. MDAnalysis accomplishes this goal by providing a toolkit of programming building blocks that provide an abstract Python interface to the simulation data — agnostic of the specific simulation package that produced it — that lends itself to interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a robust foundational library that can form the basis for new computational tools.

MDAnalysis allows one to read particle-based trajectories such as the ones produced by MD simulations or individual coordinate frames (such as biomolecules in the Protein Databank format) and access the atomic coordinates through NumPy arrays. Together with a powerful selection language and many implemented analysis algorithms, MDAnalysis provides a flexible and fast framework for complex analysis tasks. Welcoming documentation such as the User Guide https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/ make it easy to get started. New releases are downloaded a few thousand times and the academic papers describing MDAnalysis are cited more than almost two thousand times, indicating the widespread use in the academic community.",https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/GSoC-2024-Project-Ideas

If the developers need two technologies which are written in different programming languages, for instance, a C/C++ library called from NodeJS, the team usually needs to port to one of the two languages or write a wrapper around them. Maintaining a port of a library or the plumbing code is frequently error-prone, time-consuming, and does not add any value to the final product.

The main objective of MetaCall is to provide a transparent interoperability in both ways, no matter what language you are using, so you feel like you are using a library written in the same language but in fact, it may be written in C, NodeJS or any other language.

MetaCall currently provides a mechanism to introspect the types and function signatures, which allows us to provide this type info to the caller language. You can have type safety and at the same time avoid boilerplate in both directions.

It addresses the main shortcomings of embedding independent languages separately. Having a common implementation with a plugin architecture allows you to implement newer languages without rewriting more code. With a single solution you get C#, Ruby, Python or any other language you prefer. We can improve the core continuously and add new languages.

Finally, we are using the polyglot runtime in cloud computing so we take advantage of the interoperability capabilities and allow to build complex polyglot distributed systems with ease. It is possible to build monolithic and mono-repo projects that can be distributed and scaled separately through our Function as a Service built on top of MetaCall, allowing the developer to maximize the productivity without the need of DevOps plumbing or thinking about intercommunication protocols and architectural details.",https://github.com/metacall/gsoc-2024

OpenAstronomy is currently formed by [16 organisations](http://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools for different aspects of astronomy. The range of topics covered by these projects is wide, for example: 
- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data  reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; 
- [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis and visualisation code;
- [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) is a data visualization application and library to explore relationships within and among related datasets.
- [Julia Astro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia;
- And more!

This project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Because no one measurement provides a complete picture, multiple data sources must be integrated in a sensible manner. Process-based models represent an ideal framework for integrating these data streams because they represent multiple processes at different spatial and temporal scales in ways that capture our current understanding of the causal connections across scales and among data types. Three components are required to bridge this gap between the available data and the required level of understanding: 1) a state-of-the-art ecosystem model, 2) a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and 3) a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model.",https://pecanproject.github.io/gsoc_ideas.html

It bridges the gap between polystores and hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) systems. In contrast to most existing polystore systems, Polypheny offers support for data manipulation queries. Furthermore, it features a flexible schema, supporting schema changes at runtime.

Polypheny is a full database management system providing support for a rich set of data types. Due to its support for features like the enforcement of constraints, transactions, prepared statements, and batch queries, it even goes beyond of what many well-known DBMS provide.

Moreover, Polypheny comes with integrated support for several specialized database management systems. Therefore, it is able to efficiently process heterogeneous workloads. The seamless combination of data replication and data partitioning allows combining different underlying data storage engines in order to provide excellent query performance independent of the type of workload.

Polypheny even goes a step further in terms of flexibility: With ""Data Sources"" it is possible to map data on (remote) database systems into the schema of Polypheny. It also features adapters for directly querying CSV files or file systems. Thanks to GSoC 2021, Polypheny now even has support for querying the Ethereum Blockchain.

The JDBC, Python and REST query interfaces allow to easily integrate Polypheny into existing environments using industry standard techniques. It supports a broad spectrum of query languages including SQL, CQL, the MongoDB query language and the Pig query language. The powerful browser-based user interface makes managing Polypheny a pleasant experience.

R is often the tool of choice for research in statistical methodology.

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes

* an effective data handling and storage facility,
* a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
* a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
* graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
* a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

The term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.

R, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.

Many users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.

R has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2024/wiki/table%20of%20proposed%20coding%20projects

RADAR-base provides both passive and active data collection. Passive collection can be done by directly sending data from phone sensors or device sensor data through the (pRMT) app or device sensor data via cloud storage to RADAR-base or combination of these options. Active data collection using the active Remote Monitoring Technologies (aRMT) app, which includes the use of questionnaires that might ask patients about their mood, medication intake, or the severity of symptoms. All of the collected data can be extracted from the platform in structured formats.

RADAR-base community consists of software engineers, data scientists, researchers,operations engineers, bioinformaticians. The RADAR-base platform was build and maintained by The Hyve B.V (https://www.thehyve.nl/) and PhiDataLab (https://phidatalab.org/) at Kings College London under the IMI RADAR-CNS and IMI RADAR-AD project.

SageMath is a freely available open-source mathematical software system bundling the functionality of many software libraries, exposing their features in a common interface and extending on top of this with its own powerful algorithms. By leveraging the flexibility and universality of the underlying Python interpreter, SageMath is able to accommodate for a vast range of their requirements.

The mission of SageMath is to create a viable open-source alternative to all major proprietary mathematical software systems.

Python is the main programming language inside the SageMath library and also the language of choice for all interactions with the built-in objects and functions for expressing mathematical concepts and calculations. Besides a command-line and programming-library interface, its primary user interface is a dynamic self-hosted website. From the perspective of a user, the interface language is Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.

Almost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to “mix” elements from different sets for calculations.

With syslog-ng, you can collect logs from a wide range of sources, process them in near real-time and deliver them to a wide variety of destinations.

syslog-ng allows you to flexibly collect, parse, classify, and correlate logs from across your infrastructure (even from routers, embedded systems) and store or route them to log analysis tools.

By integrating with big data tools it is possible to deliver log messages to Kafka and Elasticsearch, even store logs in HDFS.

syslog-ng not only supports legacy BSD syslog (RFC3164) and the enhanced RFC5424 protocols but also JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and journald message formats.

Working with unstructured data? That's not a problem: syslog-ng comes with a set of built-in parsers, which you can combine to build very complex things.

Even if you need to collect logs from a diverse range of sources, syslog-ng's PatternDB allows you to correlate events together and transform them into a unified format.

If you need to store your log messages in a database, you don't need to look any further! We have SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL,Oracle), MongoDB. We also support inserting messages into Redis.

syslog-ng supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) too, with more in the pipeline.

syslog-ng supports sending messages to HTTP/REST services natively

Want to deliver log messages to new systems, that are not supported by any of the log management systems, then you can easily integrate it with syslog-ng by a few lines of Python code implementing a new destination. Not only destinations could be implemented, but other items of the processing pipeline (e.g.: filter, parser, etc) and not only in Python language but also in Java.",https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/wiki/GSoC2022-Idea-&-Project-list

A supernova marks the brilliant death throes of a star, during which it outshines its entire galaxy.

From the iron in your blood to the silicon in your laptop, supernovae are responsible for producing many important elements from the primordial hydrogen and helium left over from the Big Bang.

TARDIS provides a link between theory and observations: by creating synthetic spectra from theoretical assumptions and comparing these to observations, we can both interpret data and test models for why, when and how supernova explosions occur.

ENIGMA is meant to be simple to learn and even simpler to work with. ENIGMA makes it refreshingly easy to stand up simple games. Recreating Atari Pong is a job for a handful of minutes. This is true in many modern engines, but unlike most, ENIGMA scales well to positively enormous games, as the engine (and ultimately, all user code) is written in C++.

Users write code in EDL, a language similar to JavaScript (or, more to the point, Game Maker Language) which compiles intermediately to C++. The emitted C++ is optimized based on the game's asset usage, and the result is a C++ game project which can be built by any C++ compiler (we target Clang and GCC). This offers massive portability and library support.

The compiler bundles a C++ parser which crawls the engine for definitions. This theoretically allows users to access library routines directly (e.g. OpenGL), though we recommend against this for portability reasons. This framework is another good surface for GSoC projects, though it's more advanced, so we've left it unexplored in our project ideas list.

To really understand the utility of the project, consider a typical game, which uses ""rooms"" (a type of ENIGMA asset) to lay out instances of ""objects"" (game entity classes) visually. The objects contain code for specific events (such as step, draw, or keyboard) which can call out to scripts or begin timelines or start movement on paths. ENIGMA's compiler translates this to C++ and builds it against the engine after parsing both to learn how to integrate them.",https://enigma-dev.org/tracker/gsoc.php

We support the transfer of cutting-edge technology resulting from UC-originating research to industry via successful open source projects. Due to the multi-campus nature of our current efforts, the projects we support and promote cover a wide range of topics and technologies - including:

- Open Source Hardware
- AI / Machine Learning
- Storage Systems and Devices
- Data Management
- Visualization
- Performance analysis
- Reproducibility
- Cloud-based computation
All of our mentors are scientists and researchers who are actively involved in one or more of these open source projects.",https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osre24/#projects

By tailoring the operating system, libraries and configuration to the particular needs of your application, it vastly reduces virtual machine and container image sizes to a few KBs, provides blazing performance, and drastically cuts down your software stack’s attack surface.

Unikraft is developed in the spirit of open source: public discussions on Discord, open source licensing model using BSD-3-Clause, public development and management on GitHub.

It does so in the context of a vibrant community consisting of highly skilled software engineers, researchers, teachers, students and hobbyists. Periodic meetings, hackathons and a consistent presence in open source events are central to the well functioning of the community.

We use guidelines for development and maintenance to ensure the creation of high quality code.

Public releases are planned to happen once every two months. In general, we aim for a public release to happen at the last Monday of each odd month (January, March, May, etc.)

We welcome contributors and users on Discord and on GitHub. If you are looking for a fun technical project in the area of operating systems, virtualization, come aboard on Discord.",https://github.com/unikraft/gsoc/tree/staging/gsoc-2024

Under the umbrella of the X.Org Foundation can be found Linux's DRM subsystem (10% of the size of Linux), Mesa (open source 3D and video-decoding acceleration for AMD, Intel, NVIDIA,...), and Wayland. X.org's technologies underpin much of today's computing environment, and expertise in it is in high demand worldwide.

Today, as the result of more than 20 years of work by teams of leading open source developers, most of the graphical user interfaces for Unix and Linux systems rely on X.Org. On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with application, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers. In particular, it has been at the center of the recent restructuring of the Linux graphics driver stack.
